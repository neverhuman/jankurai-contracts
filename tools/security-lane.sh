# Canonical security lane wrapper for jankurai-contracts.
#
# This repository ships static JSON contracts, so its security posture is:
#  - secret scanning of the committed tree (gitleaks),
#  - workflow linting of the CI definitions (actionlint),
#  - and a software bill of materials enumerating + hashing every contract file
#    (syft-style SBOM via sha256 over schemas/ and contracts/).
# The same lane runs locally via `just security` and in CI via ops/ci/security.sh.
